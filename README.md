# Froggy

an ergonomic keyboard layout based on [Graphite](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout?tab=readme-ov-file) 

I've been playing with the graphite layout and had a few optimizations in mind, so here is the Froggy layout.
I thought that it might be more comfortable if I spaced out the punctuation keys a bit so our fingers have more 
room for letters while still having (in my opinion) logical places for punctuation.

```
/ l d w ,   . f o u ;
n r t s g   y h a e i
q x m c v   k p j z b

? L D W <   > F O U :
N R T S G   Y H A E I
Q X M C V   K P J Z B
```
