## Froggy b3
 
###### patch notes: moved some more characters around in a way that made sense to me while still maintaining good ergonomic performance.

an ergonomic keyboard layout based on [Graphite](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout?tab=readme-ov-file) 

I've been playing with the graphite layout and had a few optimizations in mind, so here is the Froggy layout.
I thought that it might be more comfortable if I spaced out the punctuation keys a bit so our fingers have more 
room for letters while still having (in my opinion) logical places for punctuation.

```
; l d w ,    . f o u /
n r t s g    y h a e i
m x q c v    k p j z b

: L D W <    > F O U ?
N R T S G    Y H A E I
M X Q C V    K P J Z B
```
