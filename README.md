# Froggy

an ergonomic keyboard layout based on [Graphite](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout?tab=readme-ov-file) 

I've been playing with the graphite layout and had a few optimizations in mind, so here is the Froggy layout.
I thought that it might be more comfortable if I spaced out the punctuation keys a bit so our fingers have more 
room for letters while still having (in my opinion) logical places for punctuation.

```
b l d w ;   / f o u j
n r t s g   y h a e i
, x m c v   k p q z .

B L D W :    ? F O U J
N R T S G    Y H A E I
< X M C V    K P Q Z >
```
Here is a graphic i made with [this website](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/) that shows where
your fingers should sit on the letters
